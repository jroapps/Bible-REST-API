# BibleRESTAPI

This is a REST API using the Bible.org Bible web service (https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service). 

I created this API using Python for one of my courses at Liberty University.

The interface gives the user the option to receive a daily Bible verse from the API returning it in text format for easy reading.
