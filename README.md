# Bible-REST-API

This is a REST API using the Bible.org Bible web service (https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service). 

I created this API using Python for one of my courses at Liberty University.

The interface gives the user the option to receive a daily Bible verse from the API returning it in text format for easy reading. The user can opt for a specific verse, a range of verses, multiple ranges of verses, the verse of the day, or a random verse.

If you do not have Python installed on your machine, you will need that first as well as pip which should be installed when you install Python.

A special import, ```requests```, also needs to be installed using:

```
pip (pip3) install requests
```

Once these are installed, you can run the script using:

```
python (python3) webclient.py
```
